QDAtScale - Collaborative platform for running quality diversity evolutionary algorithms

QDAtScale is a collaborative open-source platform that provides a scalable solution for running quality diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithms. QD algorithms, unlike traditional optimization algorithms, focus on both high-quality and diverse solutions. The search for solutions in high-dimensional spaces is guided by filling low-dimensional feature spaces that map a wide variety of high-performing solutions.

The biggest challenge of solving complex problems with high-dimensional solution spaces is the high amount of resources required to sweep even a very small portion of these. Researchers that don't have access to a cluster of HPC systems resort to running the algorithms a smaller number of iterations or take algorithmic shortcuts in hope of finding good solutions. However, this rarely happens and what can be good research backed by tangible results is often discarded. QDAtScale aims to address this issue and to become an inclusive, crowdsourced platform where anyone can join to expand its resource and scaling capabilities.
